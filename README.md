# My Prework Notes

## Description 

This is my webpage from class prework where Im able to refer to my notes as well as practice for the github workflow all at once.
I learned many things in a short amount of time, so this serves as a good place for me to refer to if i need to have a reminder on basic consepts.

## Usage

This is for someone new to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I have split these topics into 4 sections, each section containing several basic consepts discribed in layman terms to make them easier to understand. You can use the DevTool console to see the JaveScript run and pick a random subject to review. This is mostly just for personal notes as I learn more as time goes on.
