      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>JavaScript reads and executes from top to bottom, which is called control flow.</li>
       <li>In "var shape = 'circle'" 'var' makes a new variable, shape is the name of the variable, and circle is data of the variable.</li>
       <li>If statements interrupt control flow and create a loop in which conditionmust be met giving a form of logic to programs.</li>
       <li>If statemets can have multiple conditions using 'else if' statements. note: 'else if' statements are also subject to control flow.</li>
       <li>An array is a single variable that holds a group of data instead of one singular piece of data. IE: var shapes = ["triangle", "circle", "square"]</li>
       <li>In an array theres index numbers automatically assigned to each piece of data starting at 0 and counting up by 1 following control flow.</li>
       <li>You can list the data bits in arrays by using the 'for' stastement and the following three steps: Starting point of the loop, the condition of the loop, and the final step allows the araray to iterate over each item. IE: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
         console.log(shapes[x]);</li>
